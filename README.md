## Maze Generator
Based on the Maze Generator from [CodingTrain #10](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/10-dfs-maze-generator)

This version generates the maze in a circular arrangement of cells.

It also has a few other hot-key features for solving, showing cell 'length',
pause, and flipping between the rectangular and circular arrangements.
