## Maze Generator
Based on the Maze Generator from [CodingTrain #10](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/10-dfs-maze-generator)

This version generates the maze in a circular arrangement of cells.

Example #1 -- <a href="https://mrjimmo.com/HTMLDooDads/MazeGenerator/MazeGeneratorCircular.htm?rows=10&cols=10">Simple 10x10</a><br>
Example #2 -- <a href="https://mrjimmo.com/HTMLDooDads/MazeGenerator/MazeGeneratorCircular.htm?rows=10&cols=10&asbw">Simple 10x10, shown in Black & White.</a><br>

It also has a few other hot-key features for solving, showing cell 'length',
pause, and flipping between the rectangular and circular arrangements.
